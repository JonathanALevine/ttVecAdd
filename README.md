# ttVecAdd

A simple vector-addition on Tenstorrent devices using tt-Metalium.

## How to use


Before building this project. Setup the enviroment variables that Metalium needs

```bash
export ARCH_NAME=grayskull                                                                   
export TT_METAL_HOME=/path/to/your/root/of/tt-metal/
export TT_METAL_ENV=dev
```

Then build the project

```bash
cd ttPEAK
# HACK: Metalium only searches kernels under it's directories
ln -s vecadd_kernels $TT_METAL_HOME/vecadd_kernels

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

To run

```
