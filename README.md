# ttVecAdd

A simple vector-addition demo on Tenstorrent devices using tt-Metalium.

This demo works on grayskull e150 and e75.

## Setup
Before building this project. Setup the enviroment variables in `setup_env.sh` that Metalium needs, e.g.:

```bash
export ARCH_NAME=grayskull                                                                   
export TT_METAL_HOME=/path/to/your/root/of/tt-metal/
export TT_METAL_ENV=dev
```

`ln -s $(pwd)/vecadd_kernels $TT_METAL_HOME/ttvecadd_kernels` in `setup_env.sh` will also create a link in the root of TT_METAL_HOME (this is needed at this time because tt-metal looks in its root dir for kernels).

## Build
```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Run
```
